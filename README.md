Machine learning models have proven to be highly effective in photovoltaic (PV) forecasting, helping improve the accuracy of predicting solar energy generation from solar panels. Here's how in this mini project, machine learning models were used in PV forecasting:

1. Data Collection: To build accurate PV forecasting models, a significant amount of historical data is collected. This data includes solar radiation levels, temperature, cloud cover, and other relevant meteorological and environmental factors.

2. Feature Engineering: Engineers and data scientists identify key features (input variables) that impact solar energy generation. These features can include solar radiation, temperature, time of day, day of the week, and more and their importance percentages using lgmb model.

3. Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms can be employed for PV forecasting, including regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees), time series models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA), and more advanced techniques like neural networks (e.g., LSTM, CNN) and ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting). In this project, deep learning model, random forest, KNN and linear regression models were only used for performance comparison. 

4. Training and Validation: The collected data is divided into training and validation sets. The model is trained on the training data and validated on the validation data to ensure its accuracy and generalization.

5. Feature Scaling and Normalization: Data preprocessing techniques like feature scaling and normalization ensure that all features have similar ranges, which can improve the model's convergence and performance.

6. Model Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting the parameters of the machine learning model to achieve optimal performance. This step can greatly impact the accuracy of the forecasting model.

7. Cross-Validation: Cross-validation techniques help evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data. This provides a better estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data.

8. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models through ensemble methods can improve forecasting accuracy. Bagging, boosting, and stacking are common ensemble techniques used in time series forecasting.

PV forecasting models can be integrated into energy management systems, allowing utilities and grid operators to plan and manage the grid more efficiently.

Machine learning models have shown promising results in improving the accuracy of PV forecasting compared to traditional methods. They can adapt to changing conditions and provide insights that enable better energy resource planning and integration of solar energy into the grid. However, continuous monitoring, maintenance, and adaptation of the models are crucial to ensuring accurate forecasts over the long term.
